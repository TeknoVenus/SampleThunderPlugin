# SamplePluginClientLibrary
An example C++ library that can be used by 3rd party apps to invoke our SamplePlugin over COMRPC

Whilst not strictly necessary, the client library is designed to hide the complexities of connecting over COM-RPC and preventing duplication across multiple apps that wish to use the plugin.
